AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define the value of multislice computed tomography (CT) in the
      diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred 
      patients (age range: 20-92 years) who were referred to the emergency CT
      department with a clinical suspicion of AMI were prospectively included in the
      study. CT examinations were performed with a multislice (16) CT scanner and the
      protocol included pre-contrast, arterial and venous phase acquisitions. Images
      were evaluated by using multiplanar reconstruction, maximum intensity projection 
      and volume-rendering techniques at the CT workstation. RESULTS: Ninety-four
      patients (47%) underwent surgery for AMI or for other causes of acute abdominal
      pain. One hundred-six patients (53%) were followed conservatively according to
      clinical, radiologic and laboratory findings. Of the 94 patients who underwent
      surgery, 49 (25%) were found to have AMI. All of these 49 patients with a proven 
      AMI diagnosis were diagnosed with CT. In the other 45 patients who underwent
      surgery, CT findings were negative for AMI. None of the patients, who were
      followed conservatively, were eventually diagnosed as having AMI except 1
      patient. This patient was unfit for surgery although his clinical and radiologic 
      findings were consistent with AMI and died in 3 days. The sensitivity and
      specificity values of CT for the detection of AMI were calculated to be 100% for 
      each. CONCLUSIONS: Multislice CT is an effective imaging technique for the
      diagnosis of AMI with excellent sensitivity and specificity values.

TI  - Quantitative in vivo MRI evaluation of lumbar facet joints and intervertebral
      discs using axial T2 mapping.
PG  - 2388-95
LID - 10.1007/s00330-011-2198-z [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility of T2 mapping of lumbar facet joints and
      intervertebral discs in a single imaging slab and to compare the findings with
      morphological grading. METHODS: Sixty lumbar spine segments from 10 low back pain
      patients and 5 healthy volunteers were examined by axial T2 mapping and
      morphological MRI at 3.0 Tesla. Regions of interest were drawn on a single slice 
      for the facet joints and the intervertebral discs (nucleus pulposus, anterior and
      posterior annulus fibrosus). The Weishaupt grading was used for facet joints and 
      the Pfirrmann score was used for morphological disc grading ("normal" vs.
      "abnormal" discs). RESULTS: The inter-rater agreement was excellent for the facet
      joint T2 evaluation (r = 0.85), but poor for the morphological Weishaupt grading 
      (kappa = 0.15). The preliminary results show similar facet joint T2 values in
      segments with normal and abnormal Pfirrmann scores. There was no difference in
      mean T2 values between facet joints in different Weishaupt grading groups. Facet 
      joint T2 values showed a weak correlation with T2 values of the posterior annulus
      (r = 0.32) CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of a combined T2 
      mapping approach for the facet joints and intervertebral discs using a single
      axial slab.

TI  - Intraosseous lipoma presenting as a sphenoid sinus mass.
PG  - 1339-42
AB  - Intraosseous lipoma is an uncommon mesenchymal tumor that is frequently found in 
      appendecular skeleton. In extremely rare conditions, it can appear in sphenoid
      bone, and only 2 cases have been described in literature until now. We present a 
      case of lipoma in the body of the sphenoid bone mimicking sphenoid sinus tumor. A
      16-year-old man presented to Department of Otorhinolaryngology with a complaint
      of nonspecific headache. There were any clinical findings on physical
      examination. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      revealed and the diagnosis was made on these imaging findings. Other diagnostic
      technique, invasive histopathological assessment was not necessary. To our
      knowledge, this is the first case of lipoma in the body of the sphenoid bone with
      indentation to sphenoid sinus. The patient has been followed-up radiologically
      without the need for surgery for two years.

TI  - Combined occlusal and pharmacological therapy in the treatment of
      temporo-mandibular disorders.
PG  - 1296-300
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Aim of the present work is to assess the effectiveness of a scientific
      protocol built up to relieve pain in chronic temporo-mandibular disorders (TMD)
      using Michigan splint together with a pharmacological therapy compared to the
      traditional occlusal therapy by Michigan splint alone. PATIENTS: 35 adult
      patients, with signs and symptoms of TMD lasting more than 6 months, were
      enrolled into this study and divided into two groups: the first receiving
      occlusal therapy by Michigan splint and pharmacological therapy with Delorazepam 
      and Thiocolchicoside, while the second receiving occlusal therapy by Michigan
      splint and "placebo" administration. The comparisons between the two experimental
      groups were assessed using a 5 steps visual-analogue scale (V.A.S.). RESULTS AND 
      CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes from the experimental groups were statistically
      compared resulting significantly different with an improvement or disappearance
      of signs and symptoms in the treated group with respect to the placebo group at
      12 and 18 months from the beginning of the experiment (p < 0.001).

TI  - Surgery improves pain, function and quality of life in patients with spinal
      metastases: a prospective study on 118 patients.
PG  - 1970-8
LID - 10.1007/s00586-011-1867-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: There are few prospective studies on surgical outcomes and survival in
      patients with metastatic disease to the spine. The magnitude and duration of
      effect of surgery on pain relief and quality of life remains uncertain.
      Therefore, the aim of this clinical study was to prospectively evaluate clinical,
      functional, quality of life and survival outcomes after palliative surgery for
      vertebral metastases. METHODS: 118 consecutive patients who underwent spinal
      surgery for symptomatic vertebral metastases were prospectively followed up for
      12 months or until death. Clinical data and data from the European Organization
      for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 questionnaire were obtained 
      pre- and post-operatively and at regular follow-up intervals. RESULTS: Surgery
      was effective in achieving rapid improvement in axial and radicular pain,
      neurological deficit, sphincteric dysfunction and ambulatory status, with a
      complication rate of 26% and a 12 month mortality rate of 48%. Almost 50% of
      patients had complete resolution of back pain, radiculopathy and neurological
      deficit. Of the patients who were non-ambulant and incontinent, over 50% regained
      ambulatory ability and recovered urinary continence. The overall incidence of
      wound infection or breakdown was 6.8% and the local recurrence rate was 8.5%.
      There was a highly significant improvement in physical, role, cognitive and
      emotional functioning and global health status post-operatively. Greatest
      improvement in pain, function and overall quality of life occurred in the early
      post-operative period and was maintained until death or during the 12 month
      prospective follow-up period. CONCLUSION: The potential for immediate and
      prolonged improvement in pain, function and quality of life in patients with
      symptomatic vertebral metastases should be considered during the decision-making 
      process when selecting and counselling patients for surgery.

TI  - The effect of repeated restraint stress in pain-related behavior induced by
      nucleus pulposus applied on the nerve root in rats.
PG  - 1885-91
LID - 10.1007/s00586-011-1877-4 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic pain has an impact on psychological and social factors. It 
      is known that stress influences physiological and behavioral changes and affects 
      several neurotransmitter and hormonal systems. It is also known that
      corticosterone is increased by stress. The role of chronic stress in sciatica in 
      lumbar disc herniation (LDH) in rats has not been investigated. The aim of this
      study was to investigate the effect of the restraint stress (RS) on pain-related 
      behavior induced by application of nucleus pulposus (NP) in rats. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six experimental
      groups (naive group; naive + RS; sham group; sham + RS; autologous nucleus
      pulposus [NP] applied on the left L5 nerve root [NP group]; and NP + RS group).
      Von Frey tests were used to test pain-related behavior. Concentrations of plasma 
      corticosterone were measured to assess changes in levels of endogenous
      corticosterone caused by RS. Expression of ATF-3 in the left L5 DRG was examined 
      by immunohistochemical analyses in each group. RESULTS: Mechanical withdrawal
      thresholds of the NP and NP + RS groups were significantly decreased after
      surgery compared with the naive group. Although the thresholds in the NP group
      recovered after 28 days, the thresholds in the NP + RS group were significantly
      decreased during the 42 days after surgery. RS increased the concentration of
      plasma corticosterone at 21 and 42 days after surgery. In the NP and the NP + RS 
      groups, the expression of ATF-3 was significantly increased at 7 days after
      surgery. The expression of ATF-3 was sustained for 21 days by RS. CONCLUSION:
      Concentrations of plasma corticosterone were increased in three groups that
      underwent RS. The pain-related behavior persisted for the long term in the LDH
      model. The expression of ATF-3 in DRG neurons increased for 21 days by RS. These 
      results suggest that RS plays a role in the chronicity of pain-related behavior
      in the LDH rats.

AB  - PURPOSE: TNFalpha is an inflammatory mediator related to neuropathic pain
      including sciatica. Much basic research suggests that anti-TNFalpha therapy may
      be useful for the treatment of sciatica. The purpose of this study was to clarify
      the effects of etanercept in a dorsal root ganglion (DRG) compression model.
      METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g, n = 60) were used. An
      L-shaped stainless rod was used to compress the left L5 DRG in the saline and
      etanercept groups. No rod was used in the sham group. In the etanercept group, 1 
      mg of etanercept was applied locally onto the DRG at the end of surgery. Saline
      was applied in the saline and sham groups. On day 3 and day 7 after surgery, the 
      number of ED1-immunoreactive (IR) cells (macrophages) in the DRG was calculated
      by immunohistochemical methods (n = 6). In addition, double-immunofluorescence
      labeling for ED1 and TNFalpha was performed. Behavioral testing with von Frey
      filaments and a heat stimulator was performed (n = 12). RESULTS: ED1-IR cells in 
      the DRG significantly increased in the control group compared with the sham group
      (p < 0.05). Some ED1-IR cells were co-labeled for TNFalpha. In the etanercept
      group, decrease in mechanical threshold was significantly inhibited compared with
      the saline group (p < 0.05). Thermal hyperalgesia was observed in the control
      group, but in neither the sham nor etanercept group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION:
      Etanercept attenuated the pain-related behavior induced by DRG compression. These
      findings suggest that mechanical effects on the DRG might be reduced by
      etanercept in addition to the effects on nucleus pulposus in lumbar disc
      herniation.

TI  - Effects of experimentally induced low back pain on the sit-to-stand movement and 
      electroencephalographic contingent negative variation.
PG  - 123-34
LID - 10.1007/s00221-011-2880-z [doi]
AB  - It is becoming increasingly evident that people with chronic, recurrent low back 
      pain (LBP) exhibit changes in cerebrocortical activity that associate with
      altered postural coordination, suggesting a need for a better understanding of
      how the experience of LBP alters postural coordination and cerebrocortical
      activity. To characterize changes in postural coordination and pre-movement
      cerebrocortical activity related to the experience of acutely induced LBP, 14
      healthy participants with no history of LBP performed sit-to-stand movements in 3
      sequential conditions: (1) without experimentally induced LBP; NoPain1, (2) with 
      movement-associated LBP induced by electrocutaneous stimulation; Pain, and (3)
      again without induced LBP; NoPain2. The Pain condition elicited altered muscle
      activation and redistributed forces under the seat and feet prior to movement,
      decreased peak vertical force exerted under the feet during weight transfer,
      longer movement times, as well as decreased and earlier peak hip extension.
      Stepwise regression models demonstrated that electroencephalographic amplitudes
      of contingent negative variation during the Pain condition significantly
      correlated with the participants' change in sit-to-stand measures between the
      NoPain1 and Pain conditions, as well as with the subsequent difference in
      sit-to-stand measures between the NoPain1 and NoPain2 conditions. The results,
      therefore, identify the contingent negative variation as a correlate for the
      extent of an individual's LBP-related movement modifications and to the
      subsequent change in movement patterns from before to after the experience of
      acutely induced LBP, thereby providing a direction for future studies aimed to
      understand the neural mechanisms underlying the development of altered movement
      patterns with LBP.

TI  - Effects of isolated hyperinsulinaemia on sensory function in healthy adults.
PG  - 604-9
LID - 10.1055/s-0031-1286316 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Gastrointestinal symptoms such as pain, bloating, nausea and vomiting are
      more frequent in pre-diabetic states as well as established diabetes, compared to
      healthy individuals. The mechanisms behind these symptoms are multi-factorial and
      complex. Furthermore, the effect of isolated hyperinsulinaemia on visceral and
      peripheral sensory function is poorly understood. Thus, the current study aimed
      to evaluate effects of acute hyperinsulinaemia on sensory function in healthy
      adults. METHODS: The sensitivity to electrical oesophageal and median nerve
      stimulation was assessed in 15 healthy volunteers together with recording of
      evoked brain potentials. All subjects were studied both fasting and using a
      euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp. RESULTS: There was on average a 15%
      increased sensitivity to oesophageal electrical stimulation during
      hyperinsulinaemia compared to fasting state (P<0.05), but the sensation after
      median nerve stimulation remained stable (P=0.58). No significant changes in
      latencies and amplitudes of evoked brain potentials were observed after
      oesophageal or median nerve stimulation (all P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study
      suggests that acute isolated hyperinsulinaemia increases visceral sensitivity,
      but does not influence the somatic sensory function. The lack of changes in the
      evoked brain potentials may indicate that hyperinsulinaemia affects the visceral 
      sensory system at a peripheral level. Our result suggests distinct functions of
      insulin in the various parts of the nervous system, and yields further clues to
      the significance of insulin as a satiety signal.

PG  - 633-5
LID - 10.1055/s-0031-1284366 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical picture of pituitary abscesses may resemble features of 
      other pituitary pathologies including endocrine deficiencies. The characteristic 
      radiological changes, namely the ring enhancement, may aid in the diagnostic
      work-up of this very rare condition. CASE REPORT: A 40-year-old patient with
      longstanding HIV infection presented with headache and fatigue. Testing for
      pituitary function confirmed panhypopitutarism. MRI scanning demonstrated an
      inhomogeneous pituitary gland with ring-like enhancement and sphenoid sinus
      mucosa thickening. Transsphenoidal surgery was performed. Histologically CD68
      positive macrophages were found supporting the diagnosis of infectious
      hypophysitis. Under hormone replacement therapy and retroviral treatment the
      patient clinically normalized. CONCLUSION: A pituitary abscess due to infectious 
      hypophysitis is a rare cause of pituitary failure. Diagnostic signs on imaging
      may help to rapidly distinguish the cause of pituitary deficiency in patients
      with HIV infection.

PG  - 2565-71
LID - 10.1517/14656566.2011.622267 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In early 2011, the FDA gave approval to a new preparation of
      gabapentin, licensed for the treatment of post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN).
      Gabapentin is commonly used worldwide for multiple indications, which include
      neuropathic pain. The new drug combines generic gabapentin with a polymeric
      delivery system allowing for extended release and is licensed to be given only as
      a once-daily dosing regimen. AREAS COVERED: The article aims to review the
      available evidence relating to the pharmacokinetics, tolerability and efficacy of
      extended-release gabapentin (GpER). It addresses the current state of the drug's 
      progress through regulation and the intention of its manufacturer for the market.
      EXPERT OPINION: Although GpER has been approved by the FDA for once-daily use in 
      PHN, there is a relative paucity of data for both its efficacy and the optimum
      dosing schedule (once or twice a day). There are no data directly comparing GpER 
      with the immediate-release preparation or other first-line treatments for PHN.
      Therefore, the true status of GpER as a treatment option needs to be enhanced
      with additional experimental evidence for its efficacy and favourable side-effect
      profile.

      angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency.
PG  - 723-33
LID - 10.1586/eci.11.72 [doi]
AB  - Hereditary angioedema is a relatively rare genetic disorder affecting between one
      in 10,000 and one in 50,000 individuals worldwide. The most common clinical
      symptoms observed are relapsing swelling of the skin and abdominal pain attacks. 
      However, more serious and potentially fatal laryngeal attacks can also occur.
      Hereditary angioedema is most frequently caused by a deficiency of C1-inhibitor. 
      Replacement therapy with Berinert, an intravenous pasteurized C1-inhibitor
      concentrate derived from human plasma, is a recommended treatment for rapid
      resolution of acute attacks of hereditary angioedema due to C1-inhibitor
      deficiency. Prophylactic therapy with C1-inhibitor is also available. Future
      advances may improve morbidity and mortality associated with hereditary
      angioedema.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling in acute and chronic pain: an overview
      of the recent literature.
PG  - 719-28
LID - 10.1586/ecp.11.59 [doi]
AB  - In acute and chronic pain, the objective of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic
      (PKPD) modeling is the development and application of mathematical models to
      describe and/or predict the time course of the pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of analgesic agents and link PK to PD. Performing
      population PKPD modeling using nonlinear mixed effects modeling allows, apart
      from the estimation of fixed effects (the PK and PD model estimates), the
      quantification of random effects as within- and between-subject variability.
      Effect-compartment models and mechanism-based biophase distribution models that
      incorporate drug-association and -dissociation kinetics are applied in PKPD
      modeling of pain treatment. Mechanism-based models enable the quantification of
      the rate-limiting factors in drug effect owing to drug distribution versus
      receptor kinetics (since receptor kinetics are nonlinear they are discernable
      from the linear effect-compartment kinetics). It is a helpful technique in
      understanding the complex behavior of specific analgesics, such as buprenorphine,
      but also morphine and its active metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide, especially
      with respect to the reversal of opioid-induced side effects, most importantly
      life-threatening respiratory depression. One approach in chronic pain studies is 
      the application of mixture models. Mixture models do not necessarily need to take
      PK data into account and allow the objective differentiation of measured
      responses to analgesics into specific response subgroups, and as such, may play
      an important role in analyzing Phase I and II analgesia studies. Appropriate
      application of PKPD modeling leads to the improvement of current therapeutics
      with respect to dose design and outcome, understanding the interaction of
      analgesics within complex chronic pain disease processes and may play an
      important role in drug development. In the current article, novel observations
      using the aforementioned techniques on opioids, NSAIDs, epidural analgesia,
      ketamine and GABA-ergic drugs in acute and chronic pain are discussed.

AB  - There is a huge unmet need for novel medicines for the treatment of chronic pain.
      In this article, we briefly examine some of the issues associated with
      traditional approaches to the treatment of these conditions. We go on to present 
      some of the current evidence for three of the most advanced approaches to the
      treatment of pain using a biological approach and briefly review some of the
      future trends that may lead to better treatments for this debilitating condition.

      biomarkers.
PG  - 1631-51
LID - 10.1586/ern.11.147 [doi]
AB  - Human pain biomarkers are based on standardized acute activation of pain
      pathways/mechanisms and quantitative assessment of the evoked responses. This
      approach can be applied to healthy volunteers, to pain patients, and before and
      after pharmacological interventions to help understanding and profile the mode of
      action (proof-of-concept) of new and existing analgesic compounds. Standardized
      stimuli of different modalities can be applied to different tissues (multimodal
      and multi-tissue) for profiling analgesic compounds with respect to modulation of
      pain transduction, transmission, specific mechanisms and processing. This
      approach substantiates which specific compounds may work in particular clinical
      pain conditions. Human pain biomarkers can be translational and may bridge animal
      findings in clinical pain conditions, which in turn can provide new possibilities
      for designing more successful clinical trials. Biomarker based proof-of-concept
      drug studies in either volunteers or selected patient populations provide
      inexpensive, fast and reliable mechanism-based information about dose-efficacy
      relationships. This is important information in the early drug development phase 
      and for designing large expensive clinical trials.

PG  - 1619-29
LID - 10.1586/ern.11.156 [doi]
AB  - Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) and persistent idiopathic facial pain (PIFP) are two of
      the most puzzling orofacial pain conditions and affected patients are often very 
      difficult to treat. TN is characterized by paroxysms of brief but severe pain
      followed by asymptomatic periods without pain. In some patients a constant dull
      background pain may persist. This constant dull pain sometimes makes the
      distinction from PIFP difficult. PIFP is defined as continuous facial pain,
      typically localized in a circumscribed area of the face, which is not accompanied
      by any neurological or other lesion identified by clinical examination or
      clinical investigations. The pain usually does not stay within the usual anatomic
      boundaries of the trigeminal nerve distribution and is a diagnosis of exclusion. 
      Epidemiologic evidence on TN, and even more so on PIFP, is quite scarce, but
      generally both conditions are considered to be rare diseases. The etiology and
      underlying pathophysiology of TN, and more so PIFP, remain unknown. Treatment is 
      based on only few randomized controlled clinical trials and insufficiently
      evaluated surgical procedures.

AB  - Working with patients with different chronic pain syndromes can be challenging.
      Pharmacological therapies are often associated with variety of side effects.
      Mind-body modalities are thought to play a role; however, the lack of clear
      consensus and large body of clinical experience makes it hard to provide good
      evidence-based recommendation to most of our chronic pain patients. In recent
      years the Phantom Limb Pain (PLP) and to some degree Complex Regional Pain
      Syndrome (CRPS) may prove to be an exception. In this review we summarize the
      current evidence supporting use of Mirror Box Therapy and its successor,
      Immersive Virtual Reality.

TI  - An evaluation of family medicine residents' attitudes before and after a PCMH
      innovation for patients with chronic pain.
PG  - 702-11
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Prior research indicates that primary care physicians 
      have predominantly negative attitudes toward chronic pain patients, and chronic
      pain patients have predominantly low satisfaction with the care and treatment
      they receive in primary care. This current state of affairs highlights the need
      for Patient-centered Medical Home (PCMH) innovations for the treatment of chronic
      pain in primary care. The purpose of this study was to determine if a PCMH
      innovation for the treatment of chronic pain in a family medicine residency
      program can improve resident attitudes toward chronic pain patients. METHODS:
      From January 2010 to December 2010, 30 family medicine residents (two--three per 
      month) participated in twice-a-month PCMH innovation for the treatment of chronic
      pain in primary care ("pain clinic"). De-identified data from a Likert-type
      measure of negative attitudes toward chronic pain patients were extracted from
      pain clinic evaluation information that was collected shortly before (pretest)
      and shortly after (posttest) the residents' pain clinic participation. Using
      these data, we conducted a paired-samples t test to determine if residents'
      negative attitudes toward chronic pain patients had improved. RESULTS: The
      difference between residents' pretest scores (M=51.2, SD=10.9) and posttest
      scores (M=45.2, SD=9.2) was significant, suggesting that residents' negative
      attitudes toward chronic pain patients improved after participating in pain
      clinic. CONCLUSIONS: A PCMH innovation for the treatment of chronic pain in
      primary care can improve family medicine residents' attitudes toward chronic pain
      patients.

PG  - 825-33
LID - 10.2217/fca.11.58 [doi]
AB  - Patients who continue to suffer from severe and disabling angina pectoris,
      despite optimum treatment in terms of conventional pharmacological therapy and/or
      revascularization procedures, have been termed as having refractory angina
      pectoris. The future group of patients with refractory angina pectoris will be
      different from today's patients and represent a 'moving target' as risk factors, 
      efficacy of treatment and indications continue to change. Spinal cord stimulation
      (SCS) is today considered as first-line treatment of refractory angina pectoris, 
      by the European Society of Cardiology, with an anti-ischemic effect. There is
      strong evidence for SCS giving symptomatic benefits (decrease in anginal
      attacks), improved quality of life and improvement of functional status. In
      addition, SCS seems to be cost effective with a 'break-even' after approximately 
      15-16 months.

TI  - Intestinal obstruction by giant Meckel's diverticulum. Case report.
PG  - 491-4
AB  - Most cases of Meckel's diverticulum (MD) are asymptomatic and discovered by
      chance. Management of MD is controversial. The authors describe an exceptional
      case of intestinal obstruction caused by a giant MD in a patient who had
      previously undergone appendectomy. A review of the contradictory literature on
      this subject leads to the conclusion that careful consideration of clinical and
      morphological data (patient's age, ASA score, the surgical procedure to be
      performed, morphology and position of the MD, any fibrotic bands) is required
      before deciding whether or not to resect an asymptomatic MD.

TI  - Mucocele of the appendix. Two case reports.
PG  - 487-90
AB  - The authors present two cases of mucocele of the appendix and discuss them in
      relation to the literature and the clinical features of this disease. They
      clarify the definition of mucocele as an intraluminal accumulation of mucus in
      the appendix, and concentrate on the observable pathological processes, agreeing 
      on the higher frequency of mucinous cystadenoma and the possibility that mucocele
      can develop into peritoneal pseudomyxoma or degenerate into cystadenocarcinoma.
      They also note that most diagnoses are made intra-operatively during
      appendectomy, and that, in cases suspected preoperatively, thorough investigation
      with imaging techniques is very important in order to plan the best treatment.

TI  - Multicystic nephroma in an elderly man. Case report.
PG  - 483-6
AB  - Multicystic nephroma is a relatively rare tumor of the kidney presenting unclear 
      histological origin. Abdominal mass is a common onset sign in children while
      abdominal flank pain or abdominal discomfort, hematuria and recurrent urinary
      tract infections usually affect adults. Preoperative diagnosis is impossible
      especially in the adult variant of the tumor where clear cells carcinoma with
      cystic degeneration must always be suspected. We herein report a case of a 77
      year old man complaining of flank abdominal pain and recurrent episodes of
      urinary tract infection due to a right-sided multicystic nephroma successfully
      treated with nephrectomy.

TI  - Unusual case of abdominal pain following liver transplant: causality or casualty?
PG  - 467-8
AB  - This is an unusual case of chronic abdominal pain following two liver transplants
      with at least three potential causes: traumatic neuroma, intussusception of the
      small bowel of the Roux loop and biliary cast. Surgical removal of the latter two
      factors led to resolution of the pain. The management of the clinical case is
      discussed.

TI  - Transmyocardial laser revascularization. Personal experience.
PG  - 464-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Indirect revascularization is a therapeutic approach in case of
      severe angina not suitable for percutaneous or surgical revascularization.
      Transmyocardial revascularization (TMR) is one of the techniques used for
      indirect revascularization and it allows to create transmyocardial channels by a 
      laser energy bundle delivered on left ventricular epicardial surface. Benefits of
      the procedure are related mainly to the angiogenesis caused by inflammation and
      secondly to the destruction of the nervous fibers of the heart. PATIENTS AND
      METHOD: From September 1996 up to July 1997, 14 patients (9 males - 66.7%, mean
      age 64.8+/-7.9 years) underwent TMR. All patients referred angina at rest;
      Canadian Angina Class was IV in 7 patients (58.3%), III in 5 (41.7%). Before the 
      enrollment, coronarography was routinely performed to find out the feasibility of
      Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG): 13 patients (91,6%) had coronary arteries
      lesions not suitable for direct revascularization; this condition was limited
      only to postero-lateral area in one patient submitted to combined TMR + CABG
      procedures. RESULTS: Mean discharge time was 3,2+/-1,3 days after surgery. All
      patients were discharged in good clinical conditions. Perfusion thallium
      scintigraphy was performed in 7 patients at a mean follow-up of 4+/-2 months,
      showing in all but one an improvement of perfusion defects. Moreover an exercise 
      treadmill improvement was observed in the same patients and all of them are in
      good clinical conditions, with significantly reduced use of active drugs.
      CONCLUSION; Our experience confirms that TMR is a safe and feasible procedure and
      it offers a therapeutic solution in case of untreatable angina. Moreover, it
      could be a hybrid approach for patients undergoing CABGs in case of absence of
      vessels suitable for surgical approach in limited areas of the heart.

TI  - The process of symptom control in Korean women with irritable bowel syndrome.
PG  - 424-32
LID - 10.1097/SGA.0b013e318237cfdd [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome is chronic, uncontrollable, and unpredictable in nature.
      This study explored how Korean women with irritable bowel syndrome decipher the
      meaning of their symptoms and implement irritable bowel syndrome health
      management strategies. Data were collected in 2009 from 14 Korean women in their 
      20s and 30s through in-depth interviews using grounded theory. The constant
      comparative method was adopted for data analysis. The core category identified in
      the study was the "process of controlling irritable bowel syndrome symptoms."
      Strategies showed a temporal change progressing through stages of helplessness,
      searching, realization, struggling, and controlling. Early in symptom management,
      subjects tended to rely on medication or did not have a strategy. After a trial
      and error process, subjects did not use medication and natural symptom management
      that incorporated regular living habits, dietary control, and stress management. 
      The introduction of strategic nursing interventions for irritable bowel syndrome 
      based on the temporal stage of health management is recommended.

TI  - Long-term outcomes of endoscopic vs surgical drainage of the pancreatic duct in
      patients with chronic pancreatitis.
PG  - 1690-5
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2011.07.049 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: A randomized trial that compared endoscopic and surgical
      drainage of the pancreatic duct in patients with advanced chronic pancreatitis
      reported a significant benefit of surgery after a 2-year follow-up period. We
      evaluated the long-term outcome of these patients after 5 years. METHODS: Between
      2000 and 2004, 39 symptomatic patients were randomly assigned to groups that
      underwent endoscopic drainage or operative pancreaticojejunostomy. In 2009,
      information was collected regarding pain, quality of life, morbidity, mortality, 
      length of hospital stay, number of procedures undergone, changes in pancreatic
      function, and costs. Analysis was performed according to an intention-to-treat
      principle. RESULTS: During the 79-month follow-up period, one patient was lost
      and 7 died from unrelated causes. Of the patients treated by endoscopy, 68%
      required additional drainage compared with 5% in the surgery group (P = .001).
      Hospital stay and costs were comparable, but overall, patients assigned to
      endoscopy underwent more procedures (median, 12 vs 4; P = .001). Moreover, 47% of
      the patients in the endoscopy group eventually underwent surgery. Although the
      mean difference in Izbicki pain scores was no longer significant (39 vs 22; P =
      .12), surgery was still superior in terms of pain relief (80% vs 38%; P = .042). 
      Levels of quality of life and pancreatic function were comparable. CONCLUSIONS:
      In the long term, symptomatic patients with advanced chronic pancreatitis who
      underwent surgery as the initial treatment for pancreatic duct obstruction had
      more relief from pain, with fewer procedures, than patients who were treated
      endoscopically. Importantly, almost half of the patients who were treated with
      endoscopy eventually underwent surgery.

TI  - Cathepsin S is activated during colitis and causes visceral hyperalgesia by a
      PAR2-dependent mechanism in mice.
PG  - 1864-74.e1-3
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2011.07.035 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Although proteases control inflammation and pain, the
      identity, cellular origin, mechanism of action, and causative role of proteases
      that are activated during disease are not defined. We investigated the activation
      and function of cysteine cathepsins (Cat) in colitis. METHODS: Because protease
      activity, rather than expression, is regulated, we treated mice with fluorescent 
      activity-based probes that covalently modify activated cathepsins. Activated
      proteases were localized by tomographic imaging of intact mice and confocal
      imaging of tissues, and were identified by electrophoresis and
      immunoprecipitation. We examined the effects of activated cathepsins on
      excitability of colonic nociceptors and on colonic pain, and determined their
      role in colonic inflammatory pain by gene deletion. RESULTS: Tomography and
      magnetic resonance imaging localized activated cathepsins to the inflamed colon
      of piroxicam-treated il10(-/-) mice. Confocal imaging detected activated
      cathepsins in colonic macrophages and spinal neurons and microglial cells of mice
      with colitis. Gel electrophoresis and immunoprecipitation identified activated
      Cat-B, Cat-L, and Cat-S in colon and spinal cord, and Cat-S was preferentially
      secreted into the colonic lumen. Intraluminal Cat-S amplified visceromotor
      responses to colorectal distension and induced hyperexcitability of colonic
      nociceptors, which required expression of protease-activated receptor-2. Cat-S
      deletion attenuated colonic inflammatory pain induced with trinitrobenzene
      sulfonic acid. CONCLUSIONS: Activity-based probes enable noninvasive detection,
      cellular localization, and proteomic identification of proteases activated during
      colitis and are potential diagnostic tools for detection of predictive disease
      biomarkers. Macrophage cathepsins are activated during colitis, and Cat-S
      activates nociceptors to induce visceral pain via protease-activated receptor-2. 
      Cat-S mediates colitis pain and is a potential therapeutic target.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The intestinal microbiomes of healthy children and pediatric
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are not well defined. Studies in
      adults have indicated that the gastrointestinal microbiota could be involved in
      IBS. METHODS: We analyzed 71 samples from 22 children with IBS (pediatric Rome
      III criteria) and 22 healthy children, ages 7-12 years, by 16S ribosomal RNA gene
      sequencing, with an average of 54,287 reads/stool sample (average 454 read length
      = 503 bases). Data were analyzed using phylogenetic-based clustering (Unifrac),
      or an operational taxonomic unit (OTU) approach using a supervised machine
      learning tool (randomForest). Most samples were also hybridized to a microarray
      that can detect 8741 bacterial taxa (16S rRNA PhyloChip). RESULTS: Microbiomes
      associated with pediatric IBS were characterized by a significantly greater
      percentage of the class gamma-proteobacteria (0.07% vs 0.89% of total bacteria,
      respectively; P < .05); 1 prominent component of this group was Haemophilus
      parainfluenzae. Differences highlighted by 454 sequencing were confirmed by
      high-resolution PhyloChip analysis. Using supervised learning techniques, we were
      able to classify different subtypes of IBS with a success rate of 98.5%, using
      limited sets of discriminant bacterial species. A novel Ruminococcus-like microbe
      was associated with IBS, indicating the potential utility of microbe discovery
      for gastrointestinal disorders. A greater frequency of pain correlated with an
      increased abundance of several bacterial taxa from the genus Alistipes.
      CONCLUSIONS: Using 16S metagenomics by PhyloChip DNA hybridization and deep 454
      pyrosequencing, we associated specific microbiome signatures with pediatric IBS. 
      These findings indicate the important association between gastrointestinal
      microbes and IBS in children; these approaches might be used in diagnosis of
      functional bowel disorders in pediatric patients.

TI  - Correlation of awareness and practice of working postures with prevalence of
      musculoskeletal disorders among dental professionals.
PG  - 476-83; quiz 484-5
AB  - Over the last 20 years, a great many innovations have been introduced that are
      designed to reduce laborious activities; however, an unexpected consequence of
      these developments is a trend toward a sedentary lifestyle and prolonged static
      postures that are accompanied by musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). MSDs have
      become a major issue of concern because the afflictions can be severe enough to
      disable professional careers. Although clinical dentistry is a field with immense
      potential for MSDs, only a few studies have investigated this issue. The present 
      study was carried out addressing prevalence and awareness level of MSDs among 500
      dental professionals from Central India. Also, the interrelationship between
      practices of working postures with occurrence of pain in different body parts
      were assessed using a structured questionnaire format. The results were
      statistically significant, and indicated that the prevalence of MSDs is high and 
      that there is a dire need to enhance awareness regarding correct working
      postures. This study encompassed all factors that can be addressed as causes for 
      MSDs among dentists.

TI  - Comorbid physical health conditions and anxiety disorders: a population-based
      exploration of prevalence and health outcomes among older adults.
PG  - 556-64
LID - 10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2011.07.005 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary objectives of this study were to examine the likelihood of
      anxiety disorders among respondents with common physical health conditions and to
      explore the associations between this comorbidity and older adults' perceived
      mental and physical health. METHOD: The sample consisted of older adults from the
      Canadian Community Health Survey 1.2 (n=12,792). Trained lay interviewers
      assessed psychiatric disorders based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
      Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria. Physical health conditions were based
      on self-reported diagnoses by health professionals. Multiple logistic regressions
      examined whether suffering from a physical health condition increased the odds of
      any assessed anxiety disorder (panic, agoraphobia, social phobia and
      posttraumatic stress disorder). Multiple linear regressions examined associations
      between self-rated health and comorbid physical health conditions and anxiety.
      RESULTS: After adjusting for confounding variables, the presence of chronically
      painful conditions (i.e., arthritis, back pain and migraine) and of other
      commonly occurring diseases (i.e., allergies, cataracts and gastrointestinal,
      lung and heart disease) were positively associated with anxiety. The comorbidity 
      of anxiety with allergies, cataracts, arthritis and lung disease resulted in
      poorer self-rated physical and/or mental health after adjusting for confounding
      variables. CONCLUSION: Health problems in older adults are associated with
      increased odds of anxiety, and this comorbidity is associated with poorer
      self-reported health than medical problems or anxiety alone. These findings have 
      important clinical implications for health professionals.

TI  - The balancing act: endogenous modulation of pain in functional gastrointestinal
      disorders.
PG  - 1589-99
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2011-300253 [doi]
AB  - Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are characterised by visceral pain 
      or discomfort with an unknown cause. There is increasing evidence for abnormal
      processing of sensory input in FGIDs. Modulation of sensory input occurs at all
      levels of the nervous system, with a dynamic balance between facilitation and
      inhibition and close integration with the body's wider homoeostatic control.
      Cognitive, emotional, autonomic and spinal reflex pathways effectively
      orchestrate supraspinal and spinal pain modulation, as demonstrated in
      neurophysiological and brain imaging studies. Endogenous pain modulation has been
      studied in visceral pain conditions and abnormal regulation has been shown in
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia, as well as other chronic
      pain syndromes. A majority of patients with IBS have diminished pain inhibition
      or even pain facilitation compared with healthy controls. Brain imaging during
      specific activation of endogenous pain modulation demonstrates a fairly
      consistent functional hub of mainly frontal, limbic and brainstem modulatory
      regions in healthy humans. Patients with IBS have a different pattern of
      activation and a correlation between the imaging and sensory changes. Because the
      modulatory balance of inhibition and facilitation appears to be distributed
      within the same functional network, future imaging studies of modulation
      mechanisms should include conditions allowing quantification of inhibitory and
      facilitatory components. An altered modulatory balance may well be a unifying
      pathophysiological mechanism in FGID as it can be driven by both top-down (ie,
      CNS pathology) and bottom-up (ie, peripheral immune activation) influences, but
      further validation in diverse FGID groups over time is required. Therapeutic
      manipulation of the modulatory system is possible by both pharmacological and
      non-pharmacological means.

      with chronic pancreatitis.
PG  - 1554-62
LID - 10.1136/gut.2010.236620 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In patients with painful chronic pancreatitis (CP) there is increasing
      evidence of abnormal pain processing in the central nervous system. Using
      magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging, brain microstructure in areas
      involved in processing of visceral pain was characterised and these findings were
      correlated to clinical pain scores. METHODS: 23 patients with CP pain and 14
      controls were studied in a 3T MR scanner. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)
      (ie, diffusivity of water) and fractional anisotropy (FA) (ie, organisation of
      fibres) values were assessed in the amygdala, cingulate cortex, insula,
      prefrontal cortex and secondary sensory cortex. Daily pain scores and the Brief
      Pain Inventory Short Form were collected 1 week before the investigation.
      RESULTS: In grey matter, patients had increased ADC values in amygdala, cingulate
      cortex, insula and prefrontal cortex, as well as decreased FA values in cingulate
      cortex and secondary sensory cortex. In white matter, patients had increased ADC 
      values in insula and prefrontal cortex, and decreased FA values in insula and
      prefrontal cortex (all p values <0.05). An effect modification from the pain
      pattern (attacks vs continuous pain) was seen in the insula and secondary sensory
      cortex (p values <0.05), but no effect modifications from diabetes, alcoholic
      aetiology and opioid treatment were seen (all p values >0.05). Microstructural
      changes in cingulate and prefrontal cortices were correlated to patients'
      clinical pain scores. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that microstructural
      changes of the brain accompany pain in CP. The changes are likely to be a
      consequence of ongoing pain and structural reorganisation of the neuromatrix as
      also seen in other diseases characterised by chronic pain.

TI  - Response of unexplained chest pain to proton pump inhibitor treatment in patients
      with and without objective evidence of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.
PG  - 1473-8
LID - 10.1136/gut.2011.241307 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Unexplained chest pain is potentially attributable to
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) or oesophageal motility disorders.
      Reflux chest pain may occur without heartburn. We explored the response of
      unexplained chest pain to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy in randomised
      clinical trials (RCTs), differentiating patients with and without objective
      evidence of GORD. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were systematically searched for
      RCTs that reported chest pain response to PPIs in patients who had had
      pH-monitoring and/or endoscopy to differentiate GORD-positive from GORD-negative 
      subpopulations. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the Cochran Q and 
      I(2) statistics, and a fixed effect model was applied. Possible publication bias 
      was assessed by Egger's test. RESULTS: Six RCTs met the inclusion criteria. All
      used 24 h pH monitoring and/or endoscopy to define GORD-positive patients and
      improvement in chest pain to define response (five used >/=50%; one used >/=
      20%). The therapeutic gain of >50% improvement with PPIs relative to placebo was 
      56-85% in GORD-positive and 0-17% in GORD-negative patients. The RR of >50%
      improvement in chest pain with PPI versus placebo was 4.3 (95% CI 2.8 to 6.7;
      p<0.0001) for GORD-positive and 0.4 (95% CI 0.3 to 0.7; p=0.0004) for
      GORD-negative patients. Concomitant heartburn varied among trials from being an
      exclusion criterion to being essentially concordant with GORD-positive status.
      CONCLUSIONS: Unexplained chest pain in patients with endoscopic or pH-monitoring 
      evidence of GORD tends to improve, but not resolve, with PPI therapy, whereas
      GORD-negative patients have little or no response. Heartburn was a poor predictor
      of whether patients with chest pain were GORD-positive or GORD-negative by
      objective testing.

TI  - Frequency of pain crises in sickle cell anemia and its relationship with the
      sympatho-vagal balance, blood viscosity and inflammation.
PG  - 1589-94
LID - 10.3324/haematol.2011.047365 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that autonomic nervous system activity could
      be involved in the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease, but it is unclear
      whether differences in autonomic nervous system activity are detectable during
      steady state in patients with mild and severe disease. The aim of the present
      study was to compare the autonomic nervous system activity, blood rheology, and
      inflammation in patients with sickle cell anemia according to the frequency of
      acute pain crisis. DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-four healthy volunteers, 20
      patients with sickle cell anemia with milder disease, and 15 patients with sickle
      cell anemia with more severe disease were recruited. Milder disease was defined
      as having no pain crisis within the previous year. More severe disease was
      defined as having had within the previous year three or more pain crises which
      were documented by a physician and required treatment with narcotics. The
      autonomic nervous system activity was determined by spectral analysis of
      nocturnal heart rate variability. Blood viscosity determination and measurements 
      of several inflammatory markers (interleukin-6, soluble vascular cell adhesion
      molecule-1, soluble CD40 ligand and sL-selectin) were made on blood samples
      collected in steady-state conditions. RESULTS: Results showed that: 1) patients
      who had suffered more frequent pain crises had lower parasympathetic activity and
      greater sympatho-vagal imbalance than both controls and patients with milder
      disease. However, when adjusted for age, no significant difference was detected
      between the two sickle cell anemia patient groups; 2) patients who had suffered
      more frequent pain crises had higher blood viscosity than patients with milder
      disease, and this was not dependent on age. CONCLUSIONS: Results from the present
      study indicate that both the autonomic nervous system activity and blood
      viscosity are impaired in patients with sickle cell anemia exhibiting high
      frequency of pain crisis in comparison with those who did not experience a crisis
      within the previous year.

TI  - Assessment and management of pain in haemophilia patients.
PG  - 839-45
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2516.2011.02567.x [doi]
AB  - Haemophilia patients experience acute pain during joint bleeds and chronic pain
      from haemophilic arthropathy. More than 50% of haemophilia patients have painful 
      joints that cause disability and impair quality of life. Unfortunately, only a
      few clinical studies have investigated the non-pharmacological or pharmacological
      treatments for pain or the adverse effects of pain on the health and quality of
      life of children and adults with haemophilia. There are no detailed algorithms or
      guidelines for pain management in haemophilia patients, and treatment is largely 
      empirical. Therefore, a standardized approach to the management of pain in
      haemophilia patients is needed. This approach should include a close relationship
      between pain specialists and the staffs at haemophilia treatment centres;
      validated instruments specific to haemophilia for assessing pain, quality of life
      and disability; and stepwise algorithms/protocols for treatment of chronic vs.
      acute pain and prophylactic vs early treatment. A pain treatment protocol should 
      include a definition of the problem of pain and best practices for physicians. A 
      call to action is needed to standardize treatment approaches to pain and to
      develop algorithms/protocols for the management of pain in haemophilia patients. 
      This review will highlight the prevalence and devastating impact of pain in
      haemophilia patients, currently available treatment options and identify the
      unmet needs for pain management.

TI  - Celiac disease presenting as severe osteopenia.
PG  - 242-4
AB  - The authors describe a unique presentation of celiac disease as multiple
      non-traumatic fractures in a young male without gastrointestinal complaints. A
      29-year-old man presented with back pain and was found to have a non-traumatic
      compression fracture of the lumbar and thoracic spine on plain X-ray. Dual-energy
      x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) confirmed osteoporosis at the L3/L4 vertebral bodies. 
      Parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, and vitamin D levels were normal. He had no
      gastrointestinal complaints, but serologic studies were positive to include an
      elevated gliadin IgA Ab, gliadin IgG Ab, and an elevated tissue transglutaminase 
      IgA Ab. He was treated with a gluten-free diet, calcium, and vitamin D
      supplementation as well as teriparatide. Follow up bone density showed
      improvement and has no further fractures to date. Primary care physicians,
      gastroenterologists, and endocrinologists must have a high index of clinical
      suspicion for celiac disease in any patient who presents with low bone density
      regardless of the serum 25-OH vitamin D levels or presence of gastrointestinal
      complaints.

TI  - Minimally invasive video-assisted thyroidectomy 2.0: expanded indications in a
      tertiary care cancer center.
PG  - 1557-60
LID - 10.1002/hed.21633 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive video-assisted thyroidectomy (MIVAT) advantages
      include a smaller incision, less extensive surgical dissection, improved
      visualization secondary to rigid fiberoptics, and decreased postoperative pain.
      The aims of our study were to report our experience using expanded indications of
      MIVAT. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of a single surgeon's initial
      experience was carried out at a tertiary academic cancer center. RESULTS: In all,
      53 patients were identified, of whom 40 underwent total thyroidectomy and 13
      underwent hemithyroidectomy. Thyroid volume, nodule size, incision length, and
      surgical time were all examined. Most common pathology was well-differentiated
      papillary thyroid cancer (69.8%): 42% of patients had evidence of thyroiditis
      found on pathology; 17% of patients had temporary vocal cord paralysis, with only
      1 case of vocal cord paralysis persisting >6 months (1.9%). Six patients (11%)
      experienced temporary hypocalcemia, requiring postoperative calcium
      supplementation; no patients experienced permanent hypocalcemia. CONCLUSIONS: The
      use of MIVAT with expanded indications shows complication rates comparable to
      those of traditional open thyroidectomy.

TI  - Headaches and academic performance in university students: a cross-sectional
      study.
PG  - 1493-502

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the 1-year prevalence of headache, its repercussion and
      its association with the academic performance of university students. METHODS:
      Cross-sectional study. Three hundred eighty students were randomly selected out
      of the 1718, 90.5% of them were interviewed. A semi-structured interview, the
      Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were
      used. The variables related to academic performance: absenteeism, performance
      coefficient and number of failures in disciplines, were obtained by consulting
      the academic records. RESULTS: Three hundred forty-four students were
      interviewed. The headache prevalence was 87.2%. Migraine prevalence was 48.5%.
      Tension-type headache prevalence was 42.4%. During the 3 months prior to the
      interview, 8.7% sought emergency services, 30.8% missed class, and 30.8% had a
      reduction in their productive capacity because of headache. HIT-6:
      substantial/severe impact = 49%. Multiple linear regressions have shown that
      serious/very serious-impact headaches are significantly related to greater number
      of discipline failure and absenteeism. There was no association between student
      grades and headaches. CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of headache in the studied
      population was verified. A high headache impact on a student's life was
      associated with worse academic performance.

TI  - Interictal pattern-induced visual discomfort and ictal photophobia in episodic
      migraineurs: an association of interictal and ictal photophobia.
PG  - 1461-7
LID - 10.1111/j.1526-4610.2011.02010.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pattern-induced visual discomfort and photophobia are frequently
      observed symptoms in migraineurs. The presumed pathophysiologic mechanisms of
      pattern glare and photophobia seem to overlap anatomically within the central
      nervous system. OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between interictal
      pattern-induced visual discomfort and ictal photophobia in episodic migraineurs. 
      METHODS: We compared pattern-induced visual discomfort among 3 groups: controls, 
      migraineurs without ictal photophobia (MwoP), and migraineurs with ictal
      photophobia (MwP). Photophobia was assessed with a validated photophobia
      questionnaire. Visual discomfort tests were performed using 3 striped patterns
      with different spatial frequencies. After viewing the patterns for 10 seconds,
      subjects were asked to report the severity of visual discomfort using 4 scales
      (none, mild, moderate, and severe) and using a 0-10 visual analog scale (VAS). We
      compared the proportion of subjects choosing moderate-to-severe discomfort and
      the median values of VAS scores for each pattern among the 3 groups. RESULTS: We 
      enrolled 35 controls, 18 MwoP, and 44 MwP, and there were no significant
      differences in clinical features among the 3 groups. MwP reported a significantly
      higher proportion of moderate-to-severe discomfort and higher median VAS scores
      than the controls and MwoP did. The intensity of discomfort increased with higher
      frequency of visual stimuli. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that MwP experienced more
      severe pattern-induced visual discomfort as compared with the controls and MwoP.

TI  - Children's fear during procedural pain: preliminary investigation of the
      Children's Fear Scale.
PG  - 780-8
LID - 10.1037/a0024817 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Many children consider getting a needle to be one of their most
      feared and painful experiences. Differentiating between a child's experience of
      fear and pain is critical to appropriate intervention. There is no gold standard 
      one-item self-report measure of fear for use with children. OBJECTIVE: To conduct
      an initial investigation of the psychometric properties of the Children's Fear
      Scale (CFS; based on the adult Faces Anxiety Scale) with young school-age
      children. METHOD: Children and their parents were filmed during venipuncture and 
      completed pain and fear ratings immediately after the procedure (n = 100) and 2
      weeks later (n = 48). Behavioral coding of the procedures was conducted. RESULTS:
      Support was found for interrater reliability (Time 1: rs = .51, p < .001) and
      test-retest reliability (rs = .76, p < .001) of the CFS for measuring children's 
      fear during venipuncture. Assessment of construct validity revealed high
      concurrent convergent validity with another self-report measure of fear (Time 1: 
      rs = .73, p < .001) and moderate discriminant validity (e.g., Time 1: rs = -.30, 
      p < .005 with child coping behavior; rs = .41, p < .001 with child distress
      behavior). CONCLUSIONS: The CFS holds promise for measuring pain-related fear in 
      children. In addition to further investigation into the psychometric properties
      of the CFS during acute pain with a wider age range, future research could
      validate this measure in other contexts. The utility of a one-item measure of
      fear extends beyond the field of pediatric pain to other contexts including
      intervention for anxiety disorders and children in hospital.

      systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 477-91
LID - 10.1016/j.hrtlng.2011.05.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recognition of sex differences in symptom presentation of acute
      myocardial infarction (AMI) is important for timely clinical diagnosis. This
      review examined whether women are equally as likely as men to present with chest 
      pain. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of English
      language research articles published between 1990 and 2009. RESULTS:
      Meta-analysis showed women with AMI had lower odds and a lower rate of presenting
      with chest pain than men (odds ratio .63; 95% confidence interval, .59-.68; risk 
      ratio .93; 95% confidence interval, .91-.95). Women were significantly more
      likely than men to present with fatigue, neck pain, syncope, nausea, right arm
      pain, dizziness, and jaw pain. CONCLUSION: Health campaigns on symptom
      presentation of AMI should continue to promote chest pain as the cardinal symptom
      of AMI, but also reflect a wider spectrum of possible symptoms and highlight
      potential differences in symptom presentation between men and women.

TI  - Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: diagnosis and treatment.
PG  - 554-60
LID - 10.1016/j.hrtlng.2009.12.014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is an autonomic
      disorder characterized by an exaggerated increase in heart rate that occurs
      during standing, without orthostatic hypotension. Women are most frequently
      affected, and may present with palpitations, chest discomfort, shortness of
      breath, weakness, exercise intolerance, lightheadedness, presyncope, and syncope.
      METHODS: We present three cases of POTS in otherwise healthy women, and discuss
      the clinical management of different types of this orthostatic intolerance.
      RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The diagnosis was established with a tilt-table test in 1
      patient who became symptom-free with beta-blockade and nonpharmacologic
      treatment, including fluid therapy, liberal sodium intake, support hose, and a
      reconditioning exercise program. The other 2 were diagnosed through a standing
      test, serum norepinephrine levels, and red-cell volumes. One patient had
      neuropathic POTS and partially responded to b-blockade and nonpharmacotherapy.
      The other patient had hyperadrenergic POTS and responded well to
      nonpharmacotherapy, a dualacting b-blocker, and a vasoconstrictor agent. Postural
      orthostatic tachycardia syndrome is not an uncommon clinical entity and making a 
      correct diagnosis is crucial in providing appropriate treatment to restore
      patients' functional capability and quality of life.

TI  - Naproxen-induced fixed drug eruption: a case report.
PG  - 1872-4
LID - 10.1177/0960327111400105 [doi]
AB  - Naproxen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) widely used for
      symptomatic relief of arthritis and other painful disorders, such as
      dysmenorrheal. Pruritus is the most common side effect of naproxen. Fixed drug
      eruption (FDE) due to naproxen is a rarely reported side-effect. No previous
      report has declared cross-reactivity between naproxen and other propionic acid
      derivatives. A 28-year-old man, presented with edematous and erythematous patchy 
      lesion along with pruritus and inflammation on lip, have been suffering since 3
      hours. It started after taking naproxen 550 mg for headache. On detailed inquiry,
      he defined similar symptom which recurred after whenever he took naproxen. Based 
      on clinical and histopathological findings, it is evaluated as naproxen-induced
      FDE. We have tested cross-reactivity between naproxen and other propionic acid
      derivatives, and then we obtained negative result for oral provocation test with 
      flurbiprofen. Here, we present a case of naproxen-induced FDE of 28-year-old man,
      by overviewing literatures.

TI  - Catastrophizing: a predictor of persistent pain among women with endometriosis at
      1 year.
PG  - 3078-84
LID - 10.1093/humrep/der292 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endometriosis is the most common gynecological diagnosis among women 
      with chronic pelvic pain, but the underlying mechanisms of
      endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain remain unclear. Therefore, the
      objective of this study was to determine the biopsychosocial predictors of pain
      improvement among women with endometriosis. METHODS: One hundred and fifteen
      women who presented for treatment of endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain
      at a tertiary referral center at a university-based hospital participated in this
      prospective observational study of clinical practice. Participants completed
      questionnaires assessing pain, mental health and catastrophizing at entry and 1
      year follow-up. The main outcome measure assessed was the interval change in pain
      report using the McGill pain 1uestionnaire. RESULT(S): On average, participants
      experienced a 37.4% reduction in interval pain (P < 0.001). Adjusted for baseline
      pain, nulliparity (P = 0.002) and catastrophizing (P = 0.04) were associated with
      decreased probability of interval improvement in pain. Those referred for
      physical therapy had less interval pain improvement (P = 0.04). However,
      undergoing hysterectomy was a strong predictor of improvement in pain (P =
      0.008). CONCLUSION(S): Our study suggests that chronic pain in endometriosis may 
      be more akin to other idiopathic pain disorders. Specifically, biopsychosocial
      variables, such as catastrophizing, play an important role in reported severity. 
      Further research on biopsychosocial correlates of chronic pelvic pain in
      endometriosis is warranted.

TI  - Serotonergic descending inhibition in chronic pain: design, preliminary results
      and early cessation of a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1019-25
AB  - AIM: We examined whether activation of serotonergic descending pathways improves 
      pain inhibition during exercise in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)
      and comorbid fibromyalgia (FM) in comparison with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and
      sedentary, healthy controls in a double-blind randomized controlled trial with
      cross-over design. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three female CFS/FM patients, one female
      RA patient and two healthy women were randomly allocated to the experimental
      group (2 ml of citalopram intravenously) or the placebo group (2 ml of 0.9% NaCl 
      intravenously). Participants performed a submaximal exercise protocol, preceded
      and followed by an assessment of endogenous pain inhibition. Seven days later,
      groups were crossed over. RESULTS: Significant side-effects were observed in all,
      but one participant immediately after intravenous administration of citalopram.
      One CFS/FM patient withdrew because of severe post-exertional malaise.
      CONCLUSION: It was decided that proceeding with the study would be unethical. No 
      conclusion could be made regarding pain inhibition during exercise in CFS/FM
      compared to RA and controls.

TI  - Dermatology life quality index in Thai patients with systemic sclerosis: a
      cross-sectional study.
PG  - 683-7
LID - 10.4103/0378-6323.86481 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a multisystem disorder that affects
      various organ systems. Although SSc patients have both physical and psychological
      illness, psychological distress is sometimes underestimated as most physicians
      usually pay more attention to physical problems. AIMS: To evaluate
      dermatology-specific health-related quality of life (QoL) in Thai patients with
      SSc. METHODS: SSc patients, who attended the Department of Dermatology, Siriraj
      Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, between August 2009 and April 2010, were enrolled.
      The demographic data and skin manifestations of the patients were recorded. Skin 
      thickness of each patient was analyzed by modified Rodnan skin score. QoL was
      evaluated by using the validated Thai version of dermatology life quality index
      (DLQI) questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 80 patients of SSc were enrolled in
      this study. Twelve patients had limited SSc, while 68 patients had diffuse SSc.
      The mean (SD) disease duration before period of evaluation was 9 (12.8) years.
      The mean total of DLQI score was 6.3 (range, 0-23). Patients with low DLQI score 
      have longer disease duration than patients with high DLQI score (P<0.05).
      Pain/pruritus was the most significant problem to the patients. Salt and pepper
      appearance was the cutaneous finding that had association with high DLQI score.
      CONCLUSIONS: SSc had moderate impact on patient's dermatology-specific
      health-related QoL. Pain, pruritus, and obvious skin findings caused a
      significant impairment to SSc patients. Therefore, the treatment of pain and
      pruritus and prominent cutaneous findings should be taken into account to improve
      QoL of SSc patients.

TI  - Fast-track care for patients with suspected hip fracture.
PG  - 1257-61
LID - 10.1016/j.injury.2011.01.001 [doi]
AB  - Patients over 65 years of age with suspected hip fracture following low-energy
      trauma often wait a long time for examinations, X-rays, tests and surgery. There 
      may be a connection between long waiting times and complications, including
      severe pain, mental confusion, infection, pressure sores, and longer hospital
      stays. This study examines whether implementing prehospital preoperative
      procedures might lead to reduced waiting times, less postoperative pain, fewer
      complications and shorter length of care for this patient group. To "fast-track" 
      care for hip fracture patients, the ambulance nurse starts the preoperative
      procedure (usually performed in the accident and emergency department [A&E]) and 
      transfers patients directly to radiology, bypassing A&E. Results from the
      fast-track care group were compared to results from a control group, who had been
      admitted to A&E in the usual way. The study group experienced fewer complications
      and shorter hospital stays compared to the control group. This finding suggests
      that fast-track care for hip fracture patients can minimise complications,
      heighten priorities, and decrease overall length of care. Greater awareness of
      risk factors for hip fracture patients amongst hospital staff leads to improved
      patient care. Fast-track care may also decrease the workload in A&E and thus
      release more time for other patients.

TI  - Comparison of depressive symptoms during the early recovery period in patients
      with a distal radius fracture treated by volar plating and cast immobilisation.
PG  - 1266-70
LID - 10.1016/j.injury.2011.01.005 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with orthopaedic trauma experience substantial
      psychological and physical morbidities. The purpose of this study was to assess
      depressive symptoms in patients with a distal radius fracture, and to determine
      whether early use of the wrist after volar plating reduces depressive symptoms as
      compared with cast immobilisation during the early recovery period. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Twenty-six patients with a distal radius fracture, who underwent volar
      plating and were allowed immediate use of the wrist, and 24 patients treated by
      cast immobilisation for 6 weeks were prospectively compared with respect to
      depressive symptoms at week 0, and at 2, 6, 12 and 24 weeks after injury, using
      the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Physical morbidity
      was assessed using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH)
      questionnaire and a pain Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). Multivariate analysis was 
      performed to identify factors that independently predicted CES-D scores at each
      time point. RESULTS: No differences in the CES-D scores were found between the
      volar plating and the cast immobilisation groups, although volar plating group
      had marginally better CES-D scores at 24 weeks. Multivariate analysis indicated
      that CES-D scores at each time were independently associated with pain NRS scores
      at 0 and 24 weeks, and DASH scores at 6 weeks. CONCLUSION: Early use of the wrist
      after volar plating was not found to reduce depressive symptoms as compared with 
      cast immobilisation in the early treatment period following a distal radius
      fracture. Pain was found to be an important predictor of depression, suggesting
      that caution is needed to address pain during the early rehabilitation period.

TI  - Psychological factors contributing to perceptions pain intensity after acute
      orthopaedic injury.
PG  - 1214-8
LID - 10.1016/j.injury.2010.07.245 [doi]
AB  - Psychological factors are capable of influencing an individual's perception of
      pain and may mediate the evolution from acute to chronic pain. Personality
      characteristics, such as alexithymia and anxiety sensitivity, can also influence 
      perception of pain by somatising psychological distress associated with acute
      pain. The aim of this study was to understand if alexithymia and anxiety
      sensitivity interact with psychological distress at an early stage of recovery
      from orthopaedic injury, to accentuate perception of pain intensity and
      potentially mediate the development of chronic pain disorder. 62 patients who had
      recently suffered orthopaedic injury completed the British Pain Society Pain
      Rating Scale plus the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, as well as measures 
      of alexithymia and anxiety sensitivity. Pain intensity correlated with each of
      the psychological measures but a regression analysis found that only depression, 
      in combination with anxiety sensitivity, contributed to a significant amount of
      the variance in pain scores. The authors suggest that early screening after
      orthopaedic injury could identify those vulnerable to developing persisting pain 
      disorders. This could lead to effective early intervention using psychological
      methods of pain management to reduce the risk of acute pain evolving into a
      chronic pain disorder.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of parecoxib in the treatment of acute renal colic: a
      randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 697-705
AB  - PURPOSE: Although non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsNSAIDs) 
      and opioids are effective treatments for acute renal colic, they are associated
      with adverse events (AEs). As cyclooxygenase-2 selective NSAIDs may provide a
      safer alternative, we compared the efficacy and safety of parecoxib versus an
      nsNSAID in subjects with acute renal colic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Phase IV.,
      multicenter, double-blind, noninferiority, active-controlled study: 338 subjects 
      with acute renal colic were randomized to parecoxib 40 mg i.v. plus placebo (n = 
      174) or ketoprofen 100 mg IV plus placebo (n = 164). 338 subjects with acute
      renal colic were randomized to parecoxib 40 mg IV (n = 174) or ketoprofen 100 mg 
      IV(n = 164) plus placebo. Subjects were evaluated 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120
      minutes after treatment start and 24 hours after discharge. Primary endpoint was 
      the mean pain intensity difference (PID) at 30 minutes by visual analog scale
      (VAS) (per-protocol population). An ANCOVA model was used with treatment group,
      country, and baseline score as covariates. Non-inferiority of parecoxib to
      ketoprofen was declared if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI)
      for the difference between the two groups excluded the pre-established margin of 
      10 mm for the primary endpoint. RESULTS: Baseline demographics were similar. The 
      mean (SD) mPID30 min was 33.84 (24.61) and 35.16 (26.01) for parecoxib and
      ketoprofen, respectively. For treatment difference (parecoxib-ketoprofen) the
      lower bound of the 95% CI was 6.53. The mean change from baseline in VAS 30
      minutes after study medication was ~43 mm; AEs were comparable between
      treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Parecoxib is as effective as ketoprofen in the treatment
      of pain due to acute renal colic, is well tolerated, and has a comparable safety 
      profile.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive activities of indole-imidazolidine
      derivatives.
PG  - 1816-22
LID - 10.1016/j.intimp.2011.07.010 [doi]
AB  - Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) represent a group of approximately
      50 different medicines that are widely prescribed for the management of
      inflammation and that exhibit variable anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic and
      analgesic activities. Most NSAIDs also exhibit a shared set of adverse effects,
      particularly related to gastrointestinal complications; thus, the development of 
      new drugs for the treatment of chronic inflammation and pain continues to be an
      issue of high interest. Hydantoin and indole derivatives are reported to possess 
      various pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammatory and analgesic
      activities. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the potential
      anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive activities of hybrid molecules containing
      imidazole and indole nuclei. The anti-inflammatory activities of
      5-(1H-Indol-3-yl-methylene)-2-thioxo-imidazolidin-4-one (LPSF/NN-56) and
      3-(4-Bromo-benzyl)-5-(1H-indol-3-yl-methylene)-2thioxo-imidazolidin-4-one
      (LPSF/NN-52) were evaluated using air pouch and carrageenan-induced peritonitis
      models as well as an acetic acid-induced vascular permeability model followed by 
      IL-1beta and TNF-alpha quantification. To evaluate the antinociceptive activities
      of the compounds, acetic acid-induced nociception, formalin and hot plate tests
      were also performed. The anti-inflammatory activities of the compounds were
      evidenced by a reduction in both leukocyte migration and the release of TNF-alpha
      and IL-1beta in air pouch and peritonitis models. Upon acetic acid-induced
      nociception, a decrease in the level of abdominal writhing in the groups treated 
      with LPSF/NN-52 (52.1%) or LPSF/NN-56 (63.1%) was observed. However, in the hot
      plate test, none of the derivatives tested exhibited an inhibition of
      nociception. These results indicate that the compounds tested exhibited promising
      anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive activities that likely involved the
      modulation of the immune system.

AB  - We investigated the changes in characteristics of neutrophil CD11b, monocyte
      CD11b, platelet CD62P, endothelin (ET), and neutrophil CD178 in patients with
      coronary heart disease (CHD) before and after primary coronary stenting. A total 
      of 41 patients with CHD who underwent coronary stenting and 40 control subjects
      were enrolled in the study. In CHD patients, peripheral blood samples were taken 
      24 h before and 30 min, 24 h, and 72 h after successful coronary stenting. All
      markers were significantly elevated in patients with CHD compared with controls
      (P<0.05). Time-course studies revealed that the expressions of neutrophil CD11b, 
      monocyte CD11b, platelet CD62P, and ET were lower at 30 min post-operation (PO)
      compared with that at 24 h before operation (BO) (P<0.05). All levels
      significantly increased from 30 min PO to 24 h PO (P<0.05) and decreased
      thereafter until 72 h PO (P>0.05). Time course changes in neutrophil CD11b levels
      after coronary stenting were significantly higher in patients with unstable
      angina pectoris than in patients with stable angina pectoris (P<0.05). CD11b
      levels were related to CD62P in patients with CHD (P<0.05). Neutrophil CD11b and 
      monocyte CD11b levels were significantly increased in patients with CHD who
      underwent coronary stenting compared with controls (P<0.05). Results show that
      CD11b levels increased, meanwhile, the levels of CD62P and ET increased in CHD
      patients after coronary stenting. In addition, neutrophil CD178 levels of
      apoptosis factor in patients, which is important for regression of inflammation, 
      remained high for a period of time after coronary stenting.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of flupirtine in subacute/ chronic musculoskeletal pain
      - results of a patient level, pooled re-analysis of randomized, double-blind,
      controlled trials.
PG  - 637-47
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Flupirtine, a nonopioid analgesic without antipyretic or
      antiphlogistic properties, constitutes a unique class within the group of WHO-I
      analgesics. First approved in Germany on a national level in 1989, this selective
      neuronal potassium channel opener evolved rapidly into one of the most preferred 
      analgesics for the treatment of musculoskeletal pain in some European countries. 
      However, its use outside Europe was limited due to a discrepancy between the
      empirical application of the drug and supporting evidence. As a consequence, the 
      German Pain Society commissioned an independent research institute to perform a
      pooled re-analysis of all available data from randomized controlled trials
      (including some trial not yet published). METHODS: A retrospective pooled
      analysis of the individual patient data from 8 randomized controlled Phase III - 
      IV clinical trials was carried out which included patients with sub-acute and
      chronic musculoskeletal pain. The efficacy and tolerability of flupirtine at
      dosages of 100 - 400 mg/d were compared to placebo and/or active comparators.
      Data were pooled by treatment and by subject. The primary endpoint was the
      average change in pain intensity for the overall maintenance period. RESULTS: A
      total of 1,046 patients was evaluated for efficacy and 1,095 patients for safety.
      Based on 3,337 pain assessments, treatment with flupirtine and active comparators
      resulted in significant reductions in pain intensity compared to baseline
      beginning from Day 4 (flupirtine) and Day 5 (comparators) and continuing up to
      the end of the study period as well as during the overall maintenance period (all
      p < 0.001). Flupirtine prooved to be non-inferior to the active comparators (p < 
      0.001) but showed a superior tolerability profile with a significantly lower
      number of patients reporting treatment emergent adverse events (28.6 vs. 39.1%, p
      < 0.001) and a significantly lower percentage of patients who prematurely
      discontinued study medication due to these adverse events (7.1 vs. 11.7%, p =
      0.013). LIMITATIONS: The limitations in the study were confined to those inherent
      in the retrospective and pooled analysis design. CONCLUSION: On the basis of this
      pooled analysis of individual data from 8 controlled clinical trials involving
      patients suffering from sub-acute/chronic musculoskeletal pain, the efficacy of
      flupirtine was superior to placebo across its effective and approved dosage
      range. Flupirtine was at least as active as the active comparators and showed a
      superior tolerability profile with a significantly lower treatment
      discontinuation rate.

AB  - Post-herpetic neuralgia means pain which occurs for longer than one to three
      months after the resolution of the rash of herpes zoster. We conducted a study of
      30 patients having post herpetic neuralgia. All the patients were treated with
      modified Jaipur block consisting of local subcutaneous infiltration of 2%
      Xylocaine, 0.5% bupivacaine and methylprednisolone. In our study, it was seen
      that 20% patients had complete relief of pain after first injection, 60% patients
      had complete relief of pain after second injection, 10% patients had complete
      relief of pain after third injection, and only 10% patients did not respond to
      treatment. The non-responders were either old (over 60 years) or had pain lasting
      for more than two years.

      chronic haloperidol treatment.

AB  - Antipsychotic drugs are the clinical standard for the treatment of schizophrenia.
      Although these drugs work initially, many compliant patients relapse due to
      treatment failure. The known biomarkers can not sufficiently explain
      antipsychotic treatment failure. We, therefore, enquired how the dynamic
      responses of the neurotransmitters, dopamine and serotonin, change in relation to
      treatment action and failure. Rats received either short-term (2-6 d) or
      long-term (12-14 d) treatment with haloperidol, which resembled human D2 receptor
      occupancy, using osmotic mini-pumps. Dopamine and serotonin basal levels and
      responses to novelty, appetitive food, and to an aversive tail pinch were
      measured in the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens and caudate putamen using
      in-vivo microdialysis, and the behaviour was recorded. Subsequently, we used
      in-vivo voltammetry to measure dopamine overflow in the nucleus accumbens.
      Haloperidol decreased dopamine, but not serotonin baseline levels in a
      time-dependent way. Salient stimuli induced dopamine and serotonin responses.
      Short-term haloperidol treatment attenuated the mesolimbic dopamine responses to 
      aversive stimulation, while the responses to appetitive stimulation were largely 
      preserved. After long-term treatment, the initial response adaptations were
      reversed. Similar changes were also observed at the behavioural level. In-vivo
      voltammetry showed that nucleus accumbens dopamine adaptations and their reversal
      were mediated by changes in extracellular dopamine release. Chronic haloperidol
      treatment, which resembles human D2 receptor occupancy, modulates dopamine and
      behavioural responses to aversive and appetitive stimulation depending on the
      duration of treatment. Specific changes in dopamine response dynamics and their
      reversal may be a functional substrate of antipsychotic action and failure
      respectively.

TI  - Patient demographic characteristics and facial expressions influence nurses'
      assessment of mood in the context of pain: a virtual human and lens model
      investigation.
PG  - 1330-8
LID - 10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2011.05.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sex, race, and age disparities in pain assessment and treatment have 
      been reported in the literature. However, less is known about how these
      demographic characteristics influence nurses' assessment of the emotional
      experiences of patients who are in pain. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the influence
      of patient demographic characteristics and facial expressions on nurses'
      assessment of patient mood in the context of pain. DESIGN: A cross-sectional
      study employing Virtual Human (VH) technology and lens model methodology.
      SETTINGS: The current study was delivered via the internet. PARTICIPANTS:
      Participants consisted of 54 registered nurses currently engaged in clinical
      practice. Nurses were recruited from healthcare settings across the United
      States. METHODS: Nurses viewed 32 patient vignettes consisting of a video clip of
      the VH patient and text-based clinical summary information describing a
      post-surgical context. Patient sex, race, age, and facial expression of pain were
      systematically manipulated across vignettes. Participants made positive and
      negative mood assessment ratings on computerized visual analogue scales.
      Idiographic multiple regression analyses were used to examine the patient
      characteristics that were significant predictors of nurses' assessment ratings.
      Nomothetic paired samples t-tests were used to compare ratings within cue for the
      entire sample. RESULTS: The results of idiographic and nomothetic analyses
      indicated that VH sex, race, age, and facial expression cues were significant
      predictors of the mood assessment ratings of many nurses. The age cue had the
      largest impact among the demographic variables. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the
      current study suggest that patient demographic characteristics and facial
      expressions may influence how nurses assess patient emotional status in the
      clinical pain context. These findings may lead to greater awareness by individual
      nurses and nursing administrators about the influence of patient demographic
      characteristics on clinical decision-making. Future research is needed to better 
      understand these relationships, with the ultimate goal of improving patient care.

TI  - Comparison of post-dural puncture headache and low back pain between 23 and 25
      gauge Quincke spinal needles in patients over 60 years: randomized, double-blind 
      controlled trial.
PG  - 1315-22
LID - 10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2011.04.005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Even though the use of a 25 gauge or smaller Quincke needle is
      recommended for spinal anesthesia to reduce post-dural puncture headache in
      Korea, lumbar puncture in older patients using a 25 gauge or smaller Quincke
      needle can be difficult. However, most previous studies concerning post-dural
      puncture headache have chosen children, parturients, and young adults as study
      participants. OBJECTIVES: The study compared post-dural puncture headache,
      post-operative back pain, and the number of lumbar puncture attempts using a 23
      or 25 gauge Quincke needle for spinal anesthesia of Korean patients
      >60-years-of-age. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blinded controlled trial.
      PARTICIPANTS: The 53 participants who underwent orthopedic surgery under spinal
      anesthesia were recruited by informed notices from December 2006 through August
      2007 at a 200-bed general hospital located in Kyunggido. Inclusion criteria were 
      an age >60 years, ASA I-II, and administration of patient controlled analgesia
      for the first 48 h post-operatively. METHODS: The 53 patients were randomly
      allocated to either the experimental (23 gauge Quincke needle) or control group
      (25 gauge Quincke needle). All patients had 24 h bed rest post-operatively.
      Post-dural puncture headache was assessed by the Dittmann Scale and
      post-operative back pain was assessed by a visual analogue scale at 24, 48, and
      72 h post-operatively. The statistical methods included the Mann-Whitney U-test
      and Spearman correlation. RESULTS: There were no differences in post-dural
      puncture headache, and post-operative back pain at 24, 48, and 72 h
      post-operatively, and no differences in the number of lumbar punctures, with the 
      23 and 25 gauge Quincke needle. Forty-eight hour post-operative back pain was
      positively associated with the number of lumbar punctures (p=.036) and age
      (p=.040). There were no statistically significant associations among post-dural
      puncture headache, the number of lumbar punctures, and 48 h post-operative back
      pain. Pre-operative back pain was positively associated with 48 h post-operative 
      back pain (p<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The choice of a 23 or 25 gauge Quincke needle
      for spinal anesthesia has no significant influence on post-dural puncture
      headache and post-operative back pain for Korean patients greater than
      60-years-of-age. The 23 gauge Quincke needle is an option for lumbar punctures in
      this patient population.

      radiotherapy to deliver accelerated partial breast irradiation.
PG  - 788-94
LID - 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2010.06.062 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We analyzed variables associated with long-term toxicity using
      three-dimensional conformal external beam radiation therapy (3D-CRT) to deliver
      accelerated partial breast irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: One hundred
      patients treated with 3D-CRT accelerated partial breast irradiation were
      evaluated using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 scale.
      Cosmesis was scored using Harvard criteria. Multiple dosimetric and volumetric
      parameters were analyzed for their association with worst and last (W/L) toxicity
      outcomes. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients had a minimum of 36 months of toxicity
      follow-up (median follow-up, 4.8 years). The W/L incidence of poor-fair cosmesis,
      any telangiectasia, and grade >/=2 induration, volume reduction, and pain were
      16.4%/11.5%, 24.2%/14.5%, 16.1%/9.7%, 17.7%/12.9%, and 11.3%/3.2%, respectively. 
      Only the incidence of any telangiectasia was found to be predicted by any
      dosimetric parameter, with the absolute breast volume receiving 5% to 50% of the 
      prescription dose (192.5 cGy-1925 cGy) being significant. No associations with
      maximum dose, volumes of lumpectomy cavity, breast, modified planning target
      volume, and PTV, dose homogeneity index, number of fields, and photon energy used
      were identified with any of the aforementioned toxicities. Non-upper outer
      quadrant location was associated with grade >/=2 volume reduction (p = 0.02 W/p =
      0.04 L). A small cavity-to-skin distance was associated with a grade >/=2
      induration (p = 0.03 W/p = 0.01 L), a borderline significant association with
      grade >/=2 volume reduction (p = 0.06 W/p = 0.06 L) and poor-fair cosmesis (p =
      0.08 W/p = 0.09 L), with threshold distances ranging from 5 to 8 mm. CONCLUSIONS:
      No dose--volume relationships associated with long-term toxicity were identified 
      in this large patient cohort with extended follow-up. Cosmetic results were
      good-to-excellent in 88% of patients at 5 years.

AB  - PURPOSE: To correlate computed tomography (CT) imaging features of spinal
      metastases with pain relief after radiotherapy (RT). METHODS AND MATERIALS:
      Thirty-three patients receiving computed tomography (CT)-simulated RT for spinal 
      metastases in an outpatient palliative RT clinic from January 2007 to October
      2008 were retrospectively reviewed. Forty spinal metastases were evaluated. Pain 
      response was rated using the International Bone Metastases Consensus Working
      Party endpoints. Three musculoskeletal radiologists and two orthopaedic surgeons 
      evaluated CT features, including osseous and soft tissue tumor extent, presence
      of a pathologic fracture, severity of vertebral height loss, and presence of
      kyphosis. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 69 years; 24 were men and 9 were
      women. The mean worst pain score was 7/10, and the mean total daily oral morphine
      equivalent was 77.3 mg. Treatment doses included 8 Gy in one fraction (22/33), 20
      Gy in five fractions (10/33), and 20 Gy in eight fractions (1/33). The CT imaging
      appearance of spinal metastases included vertebral body involvement (40/40),
      pedicle involvement (23/40), and lamina involvement (18/40). Soft tissue
      component (10/40) and nerve root compression (9/40) were less common. Pathologic 
      fractures existed in 11/40 lesions, with resultant vertebral body height loss in 
      10/40 and kyphosis in 2/40 lesions. At months 1, 2, and 3 after RT, 18%, 69%, and
      70% of patients experienced pain relief. Pain response was observed with various 
      CT imaging features. CONCLUSIONS: Pain response after RT did not differ in
      patients with and without pathologic fracture, kyphosis, or any other CT features
      related to extent of tumor involvement. All patients with painful spinal
      metastases may benefit from palliative RT.

TI  - The antinociceptive efficacy of HWTX-I epidurally administered in rheumatoid
      arthritis rats.

AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the inflammatory kinds of arthritis in the
      clinical situation, and cytosolic Ca2+ overload has been proposed as one of the
      primary factors for many inflammatory cells activation, which lead to relative
      enzymes and inflammatory factors release. It is therefore accepted that Ca2+
      channel blockers can protect joint injury from inflammation. In the present study
      we investigated the possible molecular mechanism of the antinociceptive efficacy 
      of HWTX-I, a spider peptide toxin blocking Ca2+ channels, on the rat rheumatoid
      arthritis model. Our study demonstrates that HWTX-I can relieve pain in the
      inflammatory joints and eliminate arthrocele to some degree. Moreover, HWTX-I can
      also decrease the concentration of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and
      increase the concentration of interleukin 4(IL-4) and interleukin 10(IL-10) in
      rat's serum. HWTX-I can also decrease the mRNA expression level of related
      factors of TNF-alpha, interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) and interleukin 6(IL-6) in
      inflammatory pathways in rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, the present results
      show that the epidural administration of HWTX-I is effective in antinociception
      in the rat model of rheumatoid arthritis, which may act through its inhibition on
      certain inflammatory pathways.
